## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r map}
 map1 <- mapview(Sf_LemurData,
         col.region = "white",
        alpha.regions = 0.3,
        color = "black",
        layer.name = "Gage Height")
map1

myMap = mapview(LemurData_Raw,
         xcol = "long",
         ycol = "lat", 
         crs = 32739, 
         grid = FALSE)
myMap

myMap  <- leaflet(data=LemurData_Raw) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~long,~lat,
                   radius=(2),
                   stroke = FALSE, 
                   fillOpacity = 0.3,
                   popup = ~as.character(`slope`))
#Show the map
myMap

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
